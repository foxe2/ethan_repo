2. It is important to choose a license so that people who access your software know what they
   can do with it.  Licenses are also important because it represents a social "contract"
   that you give anyone who wants access to your program to do with it as they wish.  It is
   also important to choose a license so that everyone who wants to use your program knows
   that it is open-source and they are free to distribute the software as well.
3. A project should not be used if it doesn't have a license because the owner of the project
   may not want it to be used by other people.  Absence of a license means that basic copyright
   laws apply, which means that no one else can modify or expand upon your work.
4. While I agree that the result may not be what the Gopher team envisioned, I don't fault them 
   for not wanting to make their software completely open-source.  Oftentimes teams like this can
   have a certain vision for a project, and when you release that software to the public, your vision
   may fall short.  While I agree with the idea that users can have a profound effect on the end
   result of any program, it should ultimately be up to the developer as to whether or not they want
   to utilize the open-source community.
5. Android uses the Apache license because they understand that their software may be used by a wide
   variety of smartphone brands, and they want these different businesses to utilize the software as
   they wish.
6. We have chosen the MIT license because we understand we probably won't completely reach our goal,
   and we want to enable other groups in the future to be able to expand upon our work.
7. I believe the Apache license is the best license for the common good because it is a lot less strict
   about what developers can do with projects that have this license.  It allows complete control of what
   you do with the software.  I think the LGPL license is good for both developers and companies
   because other developers cannot sublicense their software for other purposes.
9. The project we have decided on is to make a program that will take your SIS ID and Major(s) and
   determine if you have taken the adequate courses to graduate.  Since this program is specific
   to RPI's graduation requirements, the customer/user base will be limited to RPI students.  One 
   challenge we are facing with this project is how to collect all the information of what courses
   are required to graduate for what major, along with shifting requirements year-to-year.  We
   anticipate that this project will need improvement and refinement after we're done with it, 
   in which case we have decided to assign an MIT lincese to this project, in the event that 
   anyone who wants to pick it up and build upon it in the future will have free reign to do so.
