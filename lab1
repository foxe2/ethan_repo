1. These criteria are important because they define a fine line between what is Open Source and what is not.  If these guidelines

   Jesse clearly did not mean to harm anyone in his project and yet, at the same time, I don't think he approached the problem correctly.
   Perhaps the court of public opinion would have swayed enough people for this to have a more positive outcome for Jesse.  I have to believe

   against what happened.  This is a strong example of how conglomerates can manipulate certain constructs, even something as free as the
   internet, to hamstring lone developers just looking to progress technology in the name of innovation.
