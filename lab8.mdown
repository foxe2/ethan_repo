I have not currently started my end of the project yet.  I am still waiting on one of our partners to figure out how he is going to pull and parse the data from online, at which point it shouldn't take me more than a few days to create an algorithm to parse whatever information he gives me and sort it into different categories to be analyzed.  After I figure out what classes belong to which categories, I can take the major of whatever the user is and match it up with whatever requirements their major requires of them.
